    System Requirements
    Use Case Diagram

    Activity Diagram
```

### 3.1 System Requirements

The followings are the set of requirements while designing the to do list.

- Users should be able to add, delete, edit task items
- Each task will have name, description, assignedTo, dueDate and status fields
- The app will have light and dark mode enabling the users to select the theme

### 3.2 Use Case Diagram

<img src="./img/oop_userCaseDiagram.png" alt="use case diagram" width="600" height = "350"/>

**_There are two main actors in the system:_**

- **Users** : Users can add, modify, delete tasks in the app
- **UI Display** : To display items appropriately in the corresponding columns reflecting the changes
- **Local Storage** : Store the added and edited tasks

**_Top user cases of the To do app_**

- Add task items
- Edit task items
- Delete task items
- Mark as done
- Drag and drop items among To Do, In Progress and Done columns

### 3.3 Class Diagram

Below diagram illustrates the class diagram for this project.

<img src="./img/oop_ClassDiagram.png" alt="use case diagram" width="500" height = "300"/>

The followings are the main classes of To Do Application:

- Task Manager : the building block of the App.
  - This class will be responsible for the features such as add, edit, delete and mark as done.
  - This class encapsulate tasks array list and currentId of the task.
